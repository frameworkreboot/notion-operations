## 12. Module Functionality Descriptions (Status: Complete)

### Core Components:

- **scheduled_service.py**: Main entry point for the background service that continuously polls Notion for tasks to execute and iterate on. Implements an async loop that runs every 5 minutes to check for new tasks.

- **orchestrator/orchestrator.py**: Core orchestration logic that coordinates the entire workflow. The TaskOrchestrator class retrieves tasks from Notion, determines which crew should handle each task, processes tasks with the appropriate crew, and updates Notion with the results.

- **orchestrator/notion_api.py**: Handles all Notion API interactions through the NotionAPI class. Provides methods for querying tasks with specific statuses, updating task properties and content, retrieving page blocks and comments, and handling error logging.

- **orchestrator/crew_manager.py**: Manages the selection and execution of specialized crews. Uses LLM to determine which crew should handle a task based on its content, initializes and runs the appropriate crew, and falls back to default processing when needed.

### Specialized Crews:

- **crews/research_crew/crew.py**: Implements a specialized research crew using CrewAI. The ResearchCrew class defines two agents (researcher and senior researcher) with specific tools for web search, website scraping, and information gathering. Implements a sequential process where initial research is followed by analysis and synthesis.

- **crews/research_crew/db_config.py**: Provides configuration for the research crew database, defining schemas and relationships for storing research data.

  * Create feature branch for each new feature (`git checkout -b feature/feature-name`)
  * Make regular commits during feature development
  * Push feature branch to remote (`git push origin feature/feature-name`)
  * Create pull request for code review
  * Merge to main once approved
  * Clean up feature branches after merging
- Benefits:
  * Maintains clean project history
  * Isolates feature development
  * Facilitates code review
  * Reduces merge conflicts
  * Improves traceability of changes
- Learned: Simple branch-per-feature approach provides good balance between structure and simplicity
- Learned: Regular commits with descriptive messages improve project history and make debugging easier
- Reference: N/A (workflow documentation)

## 14. Local Testing Setup (Status: Complete)
- Implemented a manual testing approach for the scheduled service:
  * Created test_scheduled_flow.py for one-time execution of the task processing flow
  * Fixed import issues by using absolute imports instead of relative imports
  * Successfully tested the orchestrator's ability to process tasks locally
  * Verified end-to-end flow from task retrieval to processing to Notion updates
- Repository improvements:
  * Added .gitignore file to exclude virtual environments and other unnecessary files
  * Removed large files from Git tracking to prevent GitHub file size limit issues
  * Cleaned up repository structure for better organization
- Learned: Python modules in the tests directory need absolute imports when run directly
- Learned: Virtual environments should be excluded from Git repositories to avoid size issues
- Reference: tests/test_scheduled_flow.py, .gitignore

## 15. Debugging Notion API Integration Issues (Status: Complete)
- Resolved critical issue with thought process recording in Notion:
  * Identified the root cause: Notion API has a 2000 character limit per rich text block
  * Fixed by implementing proper text chunking with a safety margin (1900 chars)
  * Added validation to ensure no chunk exceeds the 2000 character limit
  * Implemented fallback mechanisms for handling edge cases
- Best practices for debugging established:
  1. **Error Message Analysis**: Carefully analyze error messages for specific clues (e.g., "body.children[31].paragraph.rich_text[0].text.content.length should be ≤ `2000`")
  2. **Data Flow Tracing**: Trace how data flows through the application to identify where issues occur
  3. **Strategic Logging**: Add detailed logging at key points to understand data transformations
  4. **Chunking Strategy**: When dealing with API limits, implement chunking with safety margins
  5. **Input Validation**: Validate inputs before sending to external APIs
  6. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implement graceful fallbacks when primary approaches fail
  7. **Isolated Testing**: Create simplified test cases to isolate and verify fixes
  8. **Special Character Handling**: Check for special characters that might affect length calculations
  9. **Consistent Implementation**: Ensure consistent implementation across test and production code
  10. **Documentation**: Document the issue and solution for future reference
- Applied fixes to both test and production code:
  * Updated text chunking in test_notion_integration.py
  * Implemented consistent chunking in orchestrator/notion_api.py
  * Added robust error handling in crew_manager.py
  * Ensured synchronization between test and production implementations
- Learned: Notion API has strict character limits that require careful handling
- Learned: Proper chunking with safety margins is essential for reliable API integration
- Learned: Consistent implementation between test and production code prevents regression

  * Resolved inconsistencies between synchronous and asynchronous method calls
  * Ensured proper awaiting of async functions throughout the codebase
- Applied systematic debugging approach:
  1. **Isolated Component Testing**: Created separate test scripts to verify individual components
  2. **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed logging at each step of the execution flow
  3. **Step-by-Step Verification**: Broke down complex processes into smaller, testable steps
  4. **Timeout Handling**: Added timeouts to prevent indefinite hanging
  5. **Error Propagation**: Ensured errors were properly caught and logged rather than silently failing
- Key fixes implemented:
  * Converted synchronous methods to async in crew_manager.py
  * Fixed indentation in try-except blocks
  * Added proper error handling and logging
  * Ensured consistent async/await usage throughout the codebase
  * Added helper methods to run synchronous API calls in thread pools
